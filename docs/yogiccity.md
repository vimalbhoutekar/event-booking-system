**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

## 1. Platform Overview & Business Model

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The traditional yoga education market faces several challenges:

- Students struggle to find qualified instructors in their locality
- Instructors lack a centralized platform to reach potential students
- No standardized booking and payment system
- Difficulty in verifying instructor credentials
- Limited transparency in pricing and reviews

### 1.2 Solution

A comprehensive marketplace platform that:

- Enables location-based instructor discovery
- Provides standardized booking and payment systems
- Implements verified instructor profiles with ratings/reviews
- Offers flexible class formats (in-studio, home visits, online)
- Facilitates transparent communication between instructors and students

### 1.3 Business Model Selection

**Selected Model: Commission-Based Marketplace** ✅

#### How It Works:

1. Instructors list their classes on the platform
2. Students discover and book classes
3. Payment is processed through the platform
4. Platform deducts commission (15%)
5. Instructor receives remaining amount (85%)

#### Example Transaction Flow:

```
Class Price: ₹500
Platform Commission (15%): ₹75
Instructor Receives: ₹425
Payment Schedule: Weekly settlements every Friday
```

#### Why This Model?

**Advantages:**

- Low operational complexity - no inventory management
- Scalable architecture - easy to add new instructors
- Instructor autonomy - freedom to set prices and schedules
- Lower financial risk - no upfront payments to instructors
- Industry standard - proven model (Urban Company, Sulekha)

**Comparison with Alternatives:**

| Feature                 | Commission Model | Managed Platform     | Listing Only |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Platform Control        | Medium           | High                 | Low          |
| Revenue Stream          | Per booking      | Subscription/Booking | Advertising  |
| Instructor Independence | High             | Low                  | Very High    |
| Quality Control         | Medium           | High                 | Low          |
| Complexity              | Low              | High                 | Very Low     |
| Scalability             | High             | Medium               | High         |

### 1.4 Payment Integration Strategy

**Selected Approach: Real Payment Gateway in MVP** ✅

**Payment Partner: Razorpay**

**Rationale:**

- Indian market optimized with UPI support
- Easy integration with comprehensive documentation
- Supports multiple payment methods (UPI, Cards, NetBanking, Wallets)
- Automatic settlement features
- PCI DSS compliant

**Supported Payment Methods:**

1. UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM)
2. Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, RuPay, Amex)
3. Net Banking (all major banks)
4. Digital Wallets (Paytm, Mobikwik, Freecharge)

**Alternative: Dummy Payment System**

- Only recommended for initial concept testing
- Not suitable if onboarding real instructors
- Delays real user behavior data collection

---

## 2. User Roles & Permissions

The platform supports three distinct user roles, each with specific capabilities and restrictions.

### 2.1 ADMIN Role - Platform Management Team

Admins are the platform operators responsible for maintaining quality, resolving disputes, and ensuring smooth operations.

#### 2.1.1 Instructor Management

**A. Application Review & Verification**

**Example Decision Matrix:**

| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Valid 200hr YTT + 3 years experience | ✅ Approve        | Meets minimum requirements  |
| Only 100hr certificate               | ❌ Reject         | Below minimum certification |

| Suspicious credentials               | 🚫 Reject + Flag  | Potential fraud             |

**B. Ongoing Instructor Monitoring**

Admin dashboard displays:

- Instructor performance metrics (ratings, bookings, revenue)
- Recent reviews and feedback
- Complaint history
- Cancellation rates
- Student satisfaction scores

**Action Triggers:**

- Rating drops below 3.5 → Warning email
- 3 consecutive cancellations → Temporary suspension review
- Serious complaint → Immediate investigation
- Consistently high performance → Featured instructor badge

**C. Commission Management**

Admin can set:

- Global commission rate (default: 15%)
- Custom rates for featured instructors (e.g., 10% for high-performers)
- Promotional periods (e.g., 5% commission for first month)

**Example Commission Structure:**

```
Standard Instructors: 15% commission
Silver Badge (50+ classes, 4.5+ rating): 12% commission
Gold Badge (200+ classes, 4.8+ rating): 10% commission
Promotional New Instructor: 10% for first 30 days
```

#### 2.1.2 Content Moderation

**A. Review Management**

- Constructive criticism with specific examples
- Positive experiences and recommendations

❌ **Prohibited Content:**

- Discriminatory comments

**Example Moderation Scenario:**

**Original Review:**
"This instructor is the worst. Completely useless and wasted my money. Don't ever book!"

**Admin Action:** Flag for review
**Reason:** Violates policy - no constructive feedback, potentially inflammatory

**Resolution:** Contact student for specific concerns, offer mediation

**B. Profile Content Review**

Admin monitors:

- Instructor bio and descriptions (appropriateness)
- Uploaded photos (professional standards)
- Class descriptions (accuracy, clarity)
- Pricing (reasonable and not misleading)

**C. Dispute Resolution**

1. **Payment disputes** (student claims not attended, instructor says attended)
2. **Quality complaints** (did not match description)
3. **Cancellation disputes** (who cancelled, when)
4. **Refund requests** (outside policy window)

**Resolution Process:**

```
Dispute Raised
    ↓
Admin Reviews Evidence
- Booking history
- Communication logs

Looking forward to guiding you through your first

```
INSTRUCTOR SETS UP ONCE:
